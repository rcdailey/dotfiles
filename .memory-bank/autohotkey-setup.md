# Session: AutoHotkey SHIFT+ENTER Setup

## Status

- **Phase**: Testing
- **Progress**: 2/4 items complete

## Objective

Set up AutoHotkey v2 script on Windows to replicate macOS Karabiner SHIFT+ENTER line continuation functionality for JetBrains Rider and VS Code.

## Current Focus

Testing deployment and startup behavior on Windows environment (switched from WSL2).

## Task Checklist

- [x] Create AutoHotkey v2 script for SHIFT+ENTER line continuation
- [x] Create batch file in Windows Startup folder to auto-launch AutoHotkey script
- [ ] Run chezmoi apply on Windows to verify file placement
- [ ] Test startup behavior and verify script launches correctly

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Windows environment from WSL2
2. Run `chezmoi apply` from Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt
3. Verify files deployed to correct Windows locations
4. Test AutoHotkey script launches on startup
5. Verify SHIFT+ENTER functionality works in Rider and VS Code

## Resources

### Files Created
- `home/Documents/AutoHotkey/shift-enter-continuation.ahk` - AutoHotkey v2 script
- `home/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/shift-enter-continuation.bat` - Startup launcher

### Key Details from Windows Analysis
- **Rider executable**: `rider64.exe` (verified with AHK Window Spy)
- **VS Code executable**: `Code.exe` (confirmed working)
- **Window class**: `SunAwtFrame` for Rider

### AutoHotkey v2 Script Behavior
- Maps SHIFT+ENTER to send `\` followed by Enter
- Targets specific executables: `rider64.exe` and `Code.exe`
- Uses modern v2 syntax: `#HotIf WinActive()` and `Send()`

### Startup Method
- Uses Windows Startup folder approach (most reliable)
- Batch file launches .ahk script automatically
- No admin privileges required

## Progress & Context Log

Created session to implement AutoHotkey SHIFT+ENTER line continuation for Windows. 
Initial focus: Replicating macOS Karabiner functionality.
Objectives: Create script, set up auto-start, test functionality.

### 2025-01-26 - AutoHotkey Script Created

- Created AutoHotkey v2 script with correct executable names from Window Spy analysis
- Removed fallback targeting for cleaner implementation
- Used latest v2 syntax as requested

### 2025-01-26 - Startup Configuration Added

- Created batch file for Windows Startup folder deployment
- Chose simplest approach over PowerShell script
- Ready for testing on Windows environment

### 2025-01-26 - WSL2 Environment Issue

- Discovered running from WSL2, which can't deploy Windows-specific files
- Need to switch to Windows environment for testing
- Files created in chezmoi but not yet deployed/tested
