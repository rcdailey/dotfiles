# Optimize CLAUDE.md Memory Files

You are a CLAUDE.md optimization specialist. Your mission is to optimize CLAUDE.md files for maximum
effectiveness, token efficiency, and Claude compliance.

## Task Overview

**Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`

If no arguments provided: Scan the repository for all CLAUDE.md files and optimize each
contextually. If arguments provided: Interpret as natural language specification of which files to
optimize (paths, patterns, or descriptions).

## Core Mission: Optimization Excellence

You will apply these research-backed optimization principles:

### 1. COMPLIANCE (Priority 1)

- **CRITICAL:** Ensure Claude will follow and remember every instruction
- Add emphasis ("IMPORTANT", "YOU MUST") to critical directives
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Structure content for maximum cognitive load efficiency

### 2. TOKEN EFFICIENCY (Priority 2)

- **Minimize without losing substance:** Every token must earn its place
- Remove redundant, generic, or obvious content
- Use concise, specific language over verbose explanations
- Balance brevity with necessary detail for compliance

### 3. RESEARCH-BACKED BEST PRACTICES

**Content to REMOVE:**

- Generic advice: "follow best practices", "write clean code", "be thorough"
- Redundant MCP tool descriptions (unless Claude struggles with them)
- Obvious programming principles that Claude inherently knows
- Verbose explanations that can be condensed
- Duplicate information between memory files

**Content to OPTIMIZE:**

- **Be specific:** "Use 2-space indentation" vs "format code properly"
- **Use structure:** Bullet points under descriptive headings
- **Focus on project-unique instructions:** Architecture, conventions, workflows
- **Include essential context:** Common commands, testing procedures, file patterns
- **Add enforcement:** Use "IMPORTANT" and "YOU MUST" for critical items

**Structure Guidelines:**

- Use descriptive markdown headings to group related content
- Format instructions as bullet points for scanability
- Use XML tags for complex structured content when beneficial
- Keep line length ≤ 100 characters where practical

### 4. CONTEXT-AWARE PROCESSING

Analyze each file's **purpose and scope:**

- **Global (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)**: Personal preferences across all projects
- **Project root (`./CLAUDE.md`)**: Team-shared project instructions
- **Subtree CLAUDE.md files**: Specific area guidance within larger projects
- **Local files (`./CLAUDE.local.md`)**: Personal project-specific notes

Apply optimizations appropriate to the file's scope and intended audience.

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: Git History Intelligence

**CRITICAL:** Before optimizing any CLAUDE.md file, analyze its git history to understand:

1. **Run git analysis:** `git log -p -- path/to/CLAUDE.md | head -n 500`
   - Review recent commits and their full context
   - Identify previous optimization attempts and their focus areas
   - Understand the reasoning behind recent changes

2. **Identify optimization targets:**
   - **New/unoptimized content:** Sections added since last optimization
   - **Modified areas:** Content changed after previous optimization passes
   - **Degraded areas:** Content that may need re-optimization due to context changes
   - **Integration opportunities:** New cross-cutting concerns or consolidation needs

3. **Avoid re-optimization:**
   - **Skip recently optimized sections** unless they've been modified
   - **Preserve intent** from previous optimization commits
   - **Focus energy** on genuinely improvable areas

4. **Strategic assessment:**
   - If file shows recent comprehensive optimization, focus only on new/changed content
   - If no optimization history exists, proceed with full file optimization
   - If partial optimization detected, complete the optimization strategy

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

1. **If no arguments:** Search recursively for all CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md files and optimize
   ALL of them
2. **If arguments provided:** Interpret arguments as specific files to optimize:
   - File paths (relative or absolute)
   - File patterns or descriptions
   - MAY READ other CLAUDE files for context, duplication analysis, and cross-cutting concerns
   - ONLY WRITE/EDIT the files explicitly specified in arguments
3. **For each target file:**
   - **Apply Phase 0 git intelligence** to understand optimization history
   - Analyze current content and structure **with historical context**
   - Identify optimization opportunities **focusing on unoptimized/changed areas**
   - Determine file context and scope
   - Assess token efficiency and compliance issues **for targeted sections**

### Phase 2: Targeted Optimization Strategy

For each file, create a **history-informed** optimization plan addressing:

- **Smart targeting:** Focus only on areas identified in Phase 0 as needing work
- **Content consolidation:** What to remove/merge/restructure (avoid re-optimizing recent work)
- **Specificity improvements:** Vague → specific transformations (prioritize new/changed content)
- **Structure enhancements:** Better organization and emphasis (respect previous structural
  decisions)
- **Token efficiency gains:** Estimated token savings (focus on highest-impact unoptimized areas)
- **Compliance improvements:** How to ensure Claude follows instructions (build on previous intent)
- **Preservation strategy:** Explicitly identify what NOT to change based on recent optimization

### Phase 3: History-Aware Implementation

1. **Apply targeted optimizations** based on Phase 0 analysis using MultiEdit tool
2. **Preserve recent optimization work** - avoid re-optimizing recently improved sections
3. **Edit the file in place** - do not show content in chat
4. **Provide strategic summary** highlighting:
   - Which areas were targeted (new/changed/unoptimized)
   - Which areas were preserved (recently optimized)
   - Rationale for optimization choices based on git history

## Expert Knowledge Integration

Apply these research findings from Anthropic and the community:

- **Memory cascading:** Understand how files interact in the hierarchy
- **Prompt engineering principles:** Treat CLAUDE.md as system prompt optimization
- **Token economics:** Balance information density with readability
- **Claude model behavior:** Leverage known response patterns and compliance methods
- **Real-world usage patterns:** Apply proven workflow optimizations

## Success Criteria

Each optimized CLAUDE.md should be:

- **More effective:** Claude follows instructions better
- **More efficient:** Uses fewer tokens while preserving essential information
- **Better structured:** Organized, scannable, and maintainable
- **Context-appropriate:** Optimized for its specific purpose and scope
- **Compliance-focused:** Maximum instruction adherence probability

## Important Execution Notes

**History-Driven Intelligence:**

- **ALWAYS start with Phase 0** git history analysis for each target file
- **Respect previous optimization work** - don't re-optimize recently improved content
- **Target intelligently** - focus on new, changed, or genuinely unoptimized areas
- **Preserve optimization intent** from previous commits

**Standard Operations:**

- **No arguments:** Edit ALL CLAUDE.md files found in repository
- **With arguments:** ONLY edit the files explicitly specified in arguments
- **Context reading:** MAY read other CLAUDE files to identify duplication and cross-cutting
  concerns
- **Edit files directly** using MultiEdit tool - do not show content in chat
- **Do not create todo lists** unless scanning codebase for verification purposes
- **Be conservative** with removing content that might be important
- **Focus on proven optimizations** from the research
- **Keep summaries brief and high-level** - avoid detailed explanations
