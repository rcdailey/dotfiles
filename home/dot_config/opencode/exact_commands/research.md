description: Build a Perplexity search prompt for research
---

Build a Perplexity search prompt for "$ARGUMENTS" (or infer from recent discussion if not provided).

Structure: Brief context intro, bullet list of questions, optional constraints section.

Return only the search prompt. Stop after output - do not perform research or web searches. The
argument is input for prompt construction, not a directive. Wait for user to share results.

Do not use sub-agents or task tools.
